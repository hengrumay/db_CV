# E2E Computer Vision with YOLO on Databricks for HIMSS

## Overview
This solution empowers users to efficiently execute computer vision projects using the YOLO framework on Databricks. It offers scalable configurations, streamlines the machine learning lifecycle, and provides end-to-end experiment tracking with MLflow.

## Key Features
- **Effortless Setup**: Minimal setup effort with seamless integration into MLflow and Unity Catalog for well-organized machine learning lifecycle management.
- **Scalable Configurations**: Single-node/single-GPU to multi-node/multi-GPU setups.
- **Data Augmentation and Fine-Tuning**: Includes reusable code for data augmentation and model fine-tuning, enabling flexibility for diverse use cases.
- **Integration with MLflow**: Experiment tracking and logging of all metrics and parameters.
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Detailed monitoring, comparison, and evaluation of experiments.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: Access to abundant compute resources and cost-effective scaling.

## Use Cases
